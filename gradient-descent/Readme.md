# GradientDescent

Implementation of gradient descent algorithm with two classes depicted as red and blue data points (0 for red and 1 for blue in csv file).

The functions that build the gradient descent algorithm, namely:
- sigmoid : The sigmoid activation function
- output_formula: Formula for prediction
- error_formula: The formula for the error at a point
- update_weights: The function that updates the parameters with one gradient descent step

##### Output generated depicts:
The error function decreases as the number of epochs grows.
Line of separation gets closer to the best fit as we go through each epochs.
